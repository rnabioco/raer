\title{Apply strand correction using gene annotations}
\usage{
correct_strand(gr, genes_gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{GRanges object containing editing sites processed with
"genomic-unstranded" setting}

\item{genes_gr}{GRanges object containing reference features to annotate the
strand of the editing sites.}
}
\value{
GenomicRanges onbject containing pileup counts, with strand corrected
based on supplied genomic intervals.
}
\description{
Gene annotations are used to infer the likely strand of editing
sites. This function will operate on unstranded datasets which have been
processed using "genomic-unstranded" library type which reports variants
with respect to the + strand for all sites. The strand of the editing site
will be assigned the strand of overlapping features in the \code{genes_gr}
object. Sites with no-overlap, or overlapping features with conflicting
strands (+ and -) will be removed.
