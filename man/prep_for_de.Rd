\usage{
prep_for_de(
  se,
  type = "AI",
  edit_from = NULL,
  edit_to = NULL,
  min_prop = 0.1,
  max_prop = 0.9,
  min_samples = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{A SummarizedExperiment object}

\item{type}{OPTIONAL the type of editing event to add. Currently, only A to I
is supported ("AI") which is the default, but your own custom can be added
by setting this to "none".}

\item{edit_from}{OPTIONAL if not using a pre-built type, you can specify your
own editing. This should be a nucleotide (A, C, G, or T) and should
correspond to the nucleotide you expect in the reference. Ex. for A to I
editing events, this would be "A". If type is not "AI", both edit from and
edit_to must be set.}

\item{edit_to}{OPTIONAL if not using a pre-built type, you can specify your
own editing. This should be a nucleotide (A, C, G, or T) and should
correspond to the nucleotide you expect after the editing event. Ex. for A
to I editing events, this would be "G". If type is not "AI", both edit from
and edit_to must be set.}

\item{min_prop}{OPTIONAL the min proporation of reads edited at a site. At
least min_samples need to pass this to keep the site. Default is 0.1.}

\item{max_prop}{OPTIONAL the max proporation of reads edited at a site. At
least min_samples need to pass this to keep the site. Default is 0.9.}

\item{min_samples}{OPTIONAL the minimum number of samples passing the cutoffs
to keep a site. Default is 3.}

per sample (ref and alt counts).
