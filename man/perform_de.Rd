\usage{
perform_de(
  deobj,
  type = "edgeR",
  sample_col = "sample",
  condition_col = "condition",
  condition_control = NULL,
  condition_treatment = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deobj}{A SummarizedExperiment object prepared for de by \code{prep_for_de}}

\item{type}{OPTIONAL if edgeR or DESeq should be run. Default is edgeR}

\item{sample_col}{OPTIONAL the name of the column from colData(deobj) that
contains your sample information. Default is sample. If you do not have a
column named "sample", you must provide the appropriate sample column}

\item{condition_col}{OPTIONAL the name of the column from colData(deobj) that
contains your treatment information. Default is condition, If you do not
have a column named "condition", you must provide the appropriate condition
column}

\item{condition_control}{The name of the control condition. This must be a
variable in your condition_col of colData(deobj). No default provided.}

\item{condition_treatment}{The name of the treatment condition. This must be
a variable in your condition_col of colData(deobj).}
}
\value{
A named list - de_obj: The edgeR or deseq object used for
differential editing analysis - results_full: Unfiltered differenital
editing results - sig_results: Filtered differenial editing (FDR < 0.05) -
model_matrix: The model matrix used for generating DE results
}
\description{
Uses either edgeR or DESeq2 to perform differential editing
analysis. This will work for simple designs that have 1 treatment and 1
control. For more complex designs, we suggest you perform your own.

At the moment, this function will only find editing events specific to the
treatment, but it will be pretty straight forward to add other possible
return values.
