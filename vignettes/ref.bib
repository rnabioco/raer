  abstract = "Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by the adenosine
              deaminase that acts on RNA (ADAR) enzymes is a common RNA
              modification, preventing false activation of the innate immune
              system by endogenous double-stranded RNAs. Methods for
              quantification of ADAR activity are sought after, due to an
              increasing interest in the role of ADARs in cancer and autoimmune
              disorders, as well as attempts to harness the ADAR enzymes for
              RNA engineering. Here, we present the Alu editing index (AEI), a
              robust and simple-to-use computational tool devised for this
              purpose. We describe its properties and demonstrate its
              superiority to current quantification methods of ADAR activity.
              The AEI is used to map global editing across a large dataset of
              healthy human samples and identify putative regulators of ADAR,
              as well as previously unknown factors affecting the observed Alu
              editing levels. These should be taken into account in future
              comparative studies of ADAR activity. The AEI tool is available
              at https://github.com/a2iEditing/RNAEditingIndexer.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Since the original publication of the VCF and SAM
              formats, an explosion of software tools have been created to
              process these data files. To facilitate this a library was
              produced out of the original SAMtools implementation, with a
              focus on performance and robustness. The file formats themselves
              have become international standards under the jurisdiction of the
              Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. FINDINGS: We present a
              software library for providing programmatic access to sequencing
              alignment and variant formats. It was born out of the widely used
              SAMtools and BCFtools applications. Considerable improvements
              have been made to the original code plus many new features
              including newer access protocols, the addition of the CRAM file
              format, better indexing and iterators, and better use of
              threading. CONCLUSION: Since the original Samtools release,
              performance has been considerably improved, with a BAM read-write
              loop running 5 times faster and BAM to SAM conversion 13 times
              faster (both using 16 threads, compared to Samtools 0.1.19).
              Widespread adoption has seen HTSlib downloaded >1 million times
              from GitHub and conda. The C library has been used directly by an
              estimated 900 GitHub projects and has been incorporated into
              Perl, Python, Rust, and R, significantly expanding the number of
              uses via other languages. HTSlib is open source and is freely
              available from htslib.org under MIT/BSD license.",

  abstract = "RNA editing is a relevant epitranscriptome phenomenon able to
              increase the transcriptome and proteome diversity of eukaryotic
              organisms. ADAR mediated RNA editing is widespread in humans in
              which millions of A-to-I changes modify thousands of primary
              transcripts. RNA editing has pivotal roles in the regulation of
              gene expression or modulation of the innate immune response or
              functioning of several neurotransmitter receptors. Massive
              transcriptome sequencing has fostered the research in this field.
              Nonetheless, different aspects of the RNA editing biology are
              still unknown and need to be elucidated. To support the study of
              A-to-I RNA editing we have updated our REDIportal catalogue
              raising its content to about 16 millions of events detected in
              9642 human RNAseq samples from the GTEx project by using a
              dedicated pipeline based on the HPC version of the REDItools
              software. REDIportal now allows searches at sample level,
              provides overviews of RNA editing profiles per each RNAseq
              experiment, implements a Gene View module to look at individual
              events in their genic context and hosts the CLAIRE database.
              Starting from this novel version, REDIportal will start
              collecting non-human RNA editing changes for comparative genomics
              investigations. The database is freely available at
              http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/index.html.",
