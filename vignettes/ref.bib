  abstract = "Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by the adenosine
              deaminase that acts on RNA (ADAR) enzymes is a common RNA
              modification, preventing false activation of the innate immune
              system by endogenous double-stranded RNAs. Methods for
              quantification of ADAR activity are sought after, due to an
              increasing interest in the role of ADARs in cancer and autoimmune
              disorders, as well as attempts to harness the ADAR enzymes for
              RNA engineering. Here, we present the Alu editing index (AEI), a
              robust and simple-to-use computational tool devised for this
              purpose. We describe its properties and demonstrate its
              superiority to current quantification methods of ADAR activity.
              The AEI is used to map global editing across a large dataset of
              healthy human samples and identify putative regulators of ADAR,
              as well as previously unknown factors affecting the observed Alu
              editing levels. These should be taken into account in future
              comparative studies of ADAR activity. The AEI tool is available
              at https://github.com/a2iEditing/RNAEditingIndexer.",
